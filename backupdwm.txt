## To Backup DWM:

### Backup When you customize any of the suckless tools to your liking, 
##    you’ll know it is not as easy as editing a config file, 
##    especially after you patch them. So keeping a backup of them 
##    is not as easy as saving a dotfile to a git repository and linking it to .
##    config/name-of-program. In this section I’ll show you the steps to make a backup 
##    of your suckless tools while still having the ability to update them when a new version comes out (which doesn’t happen that often).

##  First of all you have to be in the directory of the program you want to 
##    make a backup of. Then you’ll rename the remote of the git repository from origin to upstream.

 git remote rename origin upstream

## Then you’ll go to github.com (or gitlab) and make a new repository,
##    call it the same as the program you are backing up for convenience. 
##    Then copy the repository’s URL and type:
 git add remote origin <the repository's url>

## Now if you type:
 git remote -v

## You’ll see that you have two remotes: one called “upstream” 
##    (pointing to suckless.org) 
##    and the other one called “origin” 
##    (pointing to your repository). 
##    Now all that’s left is that you push your build to the master branch of your repository, 
##    to do that you type:
 git push origin master

## If the guys at suckless update the program, all you’ll have to do is go to that program’s directory, and run the following:
 git pull upstream master
